I will be brief. I'm **Kamisama666**. Of course, this is not my real name. And not, It's not a reference to Dragon Ball (even if I love that show). It doesn't means anything in special. It's simply the nickname I use on Internet. If you want to know my real name, just visit my [LinkedIn profile](http://es.linkedin.com/pub/%C3%A1ngel-garc%C3%ADa-jim%C3%A9nez/98/980/5b1). I also have a [github page](https://github.com/Kamisama666) where I publish my code. For any question, petition or insult, send me a message to my [email](mailto:kamisama666@webmail.org).

I've started this blog for different reasons: To share my ideas and research with the community, to have a place for notes and to improve my english (I'm from Spain). 

For that reason, the contents of that blog are very likely to be a little messy. But, in general, those are some of the topics that I have preference for:

* IT systems administration and configuration
* Networking
* Programming
* Web developing
* Hacking and pentesting
* Linux
* Free software


As a final note, this blog is powered by the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/), [the Hikari theme](https://github.com/m3xm/hikari-for-Jekyll) (with some style changes by me) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
